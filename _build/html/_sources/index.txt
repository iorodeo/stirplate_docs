Open Source DIY Kit
==========================================
This is the documentation site for the `Desktop Stir Plate Kit <http://www.iorodeo.com/content/desktop-stir-plate-kit>`_. 
This kit is used to build a stir plate suitable for many lab applications such as buffer, reagent and media preparation. The kit is very easy to assemble - **no soldering** is required and **tools are included** with the kit. See Assembly Instructions beginning with :ref:`assembly_label`
The kit also includes a stir bar and 250 mL beaker so you can start using the stir plate right away. A full list of kit contents can be found on the :ref:`contents_label` page

Stir Plate Features
----------------------

* 4.5" x 4.5" surface area for beakers, flasks, cylinders and other glassware. The stir plate surface is a smooth, white material (delrin/acetal). 
* For use with glassware with a base diameter of up to 11mm max (typically up to and including 1L size flasks). 
* Stir plate height on the benchtop is 2.5". Multiple color options are available for the base.
* The stir plate is designed so that the magnet hub sits close to the stir bar (approx. 1/8" distance between magnets and bottom of flask). 
* Stir-plate has a variable speed control to allow for a range of speed from very slow to very rapid mixing.
* A blue LED indicator displays whether the stir-plate is on.
