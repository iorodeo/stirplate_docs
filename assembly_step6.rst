Step 6: Using the stir plate 
=================================================


* Plug the 3V power supply into the back of the stir plate. 
* Place the stir bar and liquid (e.g. water for testing) into the 250 mL beaker or other glassware (a 500 mL flask is shown in the image below)
* Making sure that the knob is turned all the way down (turn fully counter-clockwise) turn on the stir plate using the switch on the front. The blue LED on the board will indicate that the stir plate is on.
* Slowly turn the dial to adjust motor speed.
