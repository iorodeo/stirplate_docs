Assembly Instructions - Desktop versus Colorimeter
=====================================================

The next several pages include instructions for assembly of the Stir Plate Kits. The instructions (particularly steps 4 & 5) highlight the Desktop Stir Plate Kit. However assembly of the Colorimeter version is very similar and most of these instructions apply to both kits. 
For example, Steps 1-3 are the same for both kits, just with different acrylic enclosure parts. 
The main difference between the two kits is in the layout of the speed control PCB and motor/magnet hub in the acrylic enclosure (Step 4). In addition, Step 5 does not apply to the Colorimeter version.

Modifications to the layout of colorimeter version are highlighted further on this page: :ref:`colorimeter_label`.
